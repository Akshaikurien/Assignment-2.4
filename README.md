1. Hadoop in layman's term

Apache Hadoop is an open source framework which provides an automated distributed computing environment that supports storage of big data sets. It does that storage using a cluster of commodity machines. It then analyses this stored big data using a very simple programming model.
Hadoop Components
Storage-For storage purpose Hadoop uses HDFS
Processing-For processing Hadoop uses Map Reduce
The storage mechanism is known as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). It is based on google GFS(Google File System) white paper.
The analytical mechanism is known as Map Reduce and is based on google map reduce white paper. 

2.Components of Hadoop framework

Hadoop framework includes following four modules:
Hadoop Common: These are Java libraries and utilities required by other Hadoop modules. These libraries provides filesystem and OS level abstractions and contains the necessary Java files and scripts required to start Hadoop.
Hadoop YARN: This is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™): A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
Hadoop MapReduce: This is YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.


3. Reason to study Big Data technology

1. Data analytics is now a priority for top organizations
With market competition stiffening, top organizations are turning to data analytics to identify new market opportunities for their services and products. As things stand today, 77% of top organizations consider data analytics a critical component of business performance.

extremely high or high value when rating expertise of candidates; this is
based on a survey by CompTIA.
b• IBM, Cisco, and Oracle together advertised 26,488 open positions that
required Big Data expertise in the last twelve months.
3. Increasing pay for data analytics professionals
As the demand steadily increases and the supply remains low, data analytics professionals are getting paid more and more. In India, as it stands today, data analytics professionals are paid on average 50% more than their counterparts in other IT based professions.
• Demand for Big Data skills is extremely high, and being able to prove yourexpertise is of essence.
 According to Forbes, the median advertised salary for professionals with
Big Data expertise is $124,000 a year.
4. Increasing pay for data analytics professionals
As the demand steadily increases and the supply remains low, data analytics professionals are getting paid more and more. In India, as it stands today, data analytics professionals are paid on average 50% more than their counterparts in other IT based professions.
5. It represents perfect freelancing opportunities
In the near future, a vast majority of the workforce will not want to be tied to just one employer. People are steadily looking for ways to diversify their sources of income and methods through which they can find the perfect work-life balance
6. Develop new revenue streams
With your ability to analyze and put good data information to good use, you can easily identify new and unexploited streams of revenue generation.
